3. Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) from here.
4. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper
   installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development

   ```shell
   $ cd kumaone/

   $ pipenv install --dev
   $ pipenv install -e .
   ```
5. Create a branch for local development

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
